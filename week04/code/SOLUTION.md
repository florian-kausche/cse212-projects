# LinkedList Implementation Analysis

## Performance Analysis

### InsertTail - O(1)

- Similar to InsertHead, this operation is constant time
- Only requires updating pointers at the tail
- No traversal needed since we maintain a tail reference

### RemoveTail - O(1)

- Constant time operation like RemoveHead
- Direct access to tail node allows immediate removal
- Only requires updating the previous node's pointers

### Remove - O(n)

- Worst case requires traversing the entire list to find value
- Optimization: O(1) when value is at head or tail
- Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few pointers

### Replace - O(n)

- Must traverse entire list to find all occurrences
- Time complexity is O(n) where n is list length
- Space complexity is O(1) as we only use one pointer

### Reverse Iterator - O(n)

- Time complexity is O(n) to iterate through all elements
- Space complexity is O(1) as we only store one pointer
- Yields elements one at a time, memory efficient

## Test Cases

### InsertTail

- Empty list
- Single element list
- Multiple element list

### RemoveTail

- Empty list
- Single element list
- Multiple element list

### Remove

- Value at head
- Value at tail
- Value in middle
- Value not in list
- Empty list

### Replace

- No matches
- One match
- Multiple matches
- Empty list

### Reverse

- Empty list
- Single element
- Multiple elements
- Verify order is reversed
